## Should I turn headband off after meditation?

- After meditation, if you completely close the app, the headband will automatically disconnect from the app and be on standby with lower consumption.

- If you meditate regularly, there is no need to turn it off every time. But the battery may last shorter than 8 hours as standby mode also costs power.

- But if you are not going to use it for a long time, please shut it down by holding the power button till the light out. 

- Please store the headband in a carrying case to protect the sensors avoiding any folding or bruises.
