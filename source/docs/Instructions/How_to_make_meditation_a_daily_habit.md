## How to make meditation a daily habit?

Meditation has been scientifically proved to have numerous benefits to our mind and body, yet it can feel hard to make it a routine.

You maybe have told yourself several times, “ I’ve got to start meditating!” It goes well for a few days, perhaps even a week. One day, you skip it because of an unpredictable schedule or excuses like deadlines, or lack of time. Then again, and again. One day you just stop.

Before you blame yourself as a “bad” meditator, please know that, simply because you have given it a try and done meditation, you are already ahead of most people. It’s okay if you get distracted. Just note what distracts you and let it go. The magic moments are those when your mind comes back.

**Meditation is about creating a practice.** It’s training. And when you’re training, it’s okay to mess up. A training program for the mind works better if it’s part of your routine. Making meditation a habit and closing the rings every day would be easier if you:

**1. Start Small**

Start with one to three and then five minutes. Soon 10 or 15 minutes would be doable.

**2. Find A Time That Works**

Making it part of your morning routine is fine. But an afternoon reset or end-of-day wind-down is also perfect timing. You may set reminder alerts for times of day when you would be likely to be in a quiet place.

**3. Encourage Each Other**

Checking in with someone every day helps you stick to it. Just be careful if you get competitive—it should feel like a supportive, encouraging relationship.

**4. Remember It's Not A Magic**

You may still experience stress and sadness. But it gives you the tools to recognize those feelings when they arise and deal with them in a healthy way.

Meditation is a journey where you enjoy the little moments of calm and still, and take a break from the craziness of your regular life.
