## How to record a session with other meditation apps?

Flowtime can work simultaneously with other meditation apps. Feel free to use Flowtime to record biodata while meditating with the guide/sound of other meditation apps.  


Flowtime biodata helps to visualize the effect of meditation sessions in other apps.  


Follow these steps: 

1. Open other meditation apps and find the session/ambient sound you are going to listen to. 

2. Open the Flowtime app and tap on the “Meditation Timer” card to select a time that is a bit longer than the length of your meditation session in case the end sound ringing when the timer ends would distract you. Or customize a timer. Then click Start.  

3. Go back to the other meditation app and start playing the meditation guide/sound. 

4. Return to the Flowtime app to keep it running in the foreground. 

5. After the audio stops, end the session and view the report.
