- When it's charging, it will be disconnected from the app.

**How do I know if it's fully charged?**
- The indicator turns solid green when it's fully charged.

- After you connect the headband with the app, you can see the battery percentage by going to Meditate page and tapping the headband icon on the top right corner. 


**What should I do if the indicator doesn't turn solid green after the headband is charged for more than 2 hours?**

- Leave it charging overnight and see whether the indicator turns solid green.
