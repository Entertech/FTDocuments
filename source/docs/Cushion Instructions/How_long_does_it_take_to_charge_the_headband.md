## How long does it take to charge the cushion?

- Attach the included magnetic charging cable to the control box through the opening under the carrying handle. 
- Connect the other end of the charging cable to the power adapter. A regular mobile phone power adapter works fine.
- The indicator light flashes red when charging and takes approximately 2 hours to charge fully.
- When it's fully charged, it can be used continuously for about 2000 hours.
- When charging, the cushion will disconnect from the app.
