## How to sit properly to have good data?

1. Before each use, adjust the cushion to be flat and stable, which helps the cushion to fit more closely to the hips and evenly distribute the stress, making it more comfortable to sit on.
2. Gently shake the cushion to take advantage of the fluidity of the buckwheat hulls, so that the inner padding is even and flat, and then sit down naturally.

3. Try to sit on the front side of the cushion so that your body weight is forward.

4. Coil your legs comfortably on the lower cushion, with your knees as close to the ground as possible to help lower your center of gravity. In this way,  you will sit stably and comfortably with your body upright for a longer time.
