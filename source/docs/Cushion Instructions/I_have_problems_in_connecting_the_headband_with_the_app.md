## I have problems in connecting the cushion with the app.

- **Make sure the cushion is on standby for pairing.**The cushion will be ready for pairing after you sit on it; you can also press the key to make it ready and the indicator will flash blue.
  
- If there is no light, please charge the cushion for more than 10 minutes and try again.

- Make sure the Bluetooth works. Check and confirm **Bluetooth is turned on.** If it's on, **turn it off and reopen it.**

- Make sure the cushion is near your phone.

- Other Bluetooth devices may interfere with the cushion when it is connecting with the app. Please keep them far away.

If you have an Android phone, please allow the app to have the location permission before connecting.

- **Try to connect the cushion again. If it doesn't work as well, please restart your phone.**
