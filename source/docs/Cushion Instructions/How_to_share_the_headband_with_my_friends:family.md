## How to share the cushion with my friends/family?

- You can share the cushion, but we do not recommend you to share your account to make sure the data in your account is yours and reflects how you are performing and going better.

- If the cushion is already paired with your app, close your app and the cushion will disconnect from the app automatically. At this time, the light flashes rapidly, which means it's ready to pair. 

- when the cushion is ready to pair, sign up for another account and tap the icon on the upper right corner of the screen in the app and connect the cushion with the new account as the instruction says.
