## There is no real-time biodata displayed.

- When the signal quality is poor, the real-time data does not show up. Generally, when you just sit down, it usually takes a while to calibrate and generate good data.
- If the real-time data does not display for a long time, please try to lift the top cushion, tap and shake it to make the inner buckwheat hull restore fluidity, and then put it down. Gently pat it flat before you sit down.
- After sitting down, ensure that your body is in full contact with the front of the cushion, so that your center of gravity is in the forward position of the cushion.
