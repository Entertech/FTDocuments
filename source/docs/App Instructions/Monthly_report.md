## What's in the Monthly Reportï¼Ÿ

Flowtime app helps you track your brain and body activities to optimize your mental state and well-being.

You can see monthly and yearly trends of each metric in the app. But we believe that monthly reviews and reflections are crucial to building long-term habits and achieving improvement. By looking at your data, you can celebrate your achievements, identify your strengths and weaknesses, set realistic goals, and plan your actions for the next month.

Within a few steps, you'll have the personalized summary of your productivity and well-being data right there in your email box.

- Go to Me - Monthly report to register your email address. Then at the beginning of each month, you'll get your report, and you can review your performance and progress over the past month.

- You can also tap "Get Report Now" for a report containing the last 30-day data in several minutes.

The Monthly Report will show you various statistics and insights about your meditation sessions, such as:

- Goals you completed and how much you exceeded them.
  
- The trends of each metric. You can see how consistently you meditated regularly and how your performance changed over time.
  
- The average, maximum, and minimum values of each metric. These values can help you identify your strengths and areas for improvement in your meditation practice.

The Monthly Report is a valuable tool to help you monitor your meditation progress and motivate you to keep improving your mental health and well-being with Flowtime.
