## Coherence Time Trend

The Coherence time statistics chart records the trend of the accumulated duration of the coherent state.

Heart rate curve reflects coherence (heart rate changes disorderly in the gray part, and a coherent state is achieved through regular deep breathing in the green part)

### Session View

The session view records the time period of the coherent state during the session.

### Month View

The month view reflects the trend of daily duration of coherent state in the last 1 month, and the abscissa is the date. The height of each bar in the bar graph represents the sum of duration of coherent state that day. A short-term trend in coherence can be seen from the month view.

### Year View

The year view reflects the trend of monthly duration of coherent state in the last 1 year, with the abscissa as the month. The height of each bar in the histogram represents the total duration of coherent state for the month. The long-term trend in coherence can be seen from the year view.
