## What is Resonant Breathing?

When you **inhale for 5 seconds and exhale for 5 seconds**, this constitutes a 10-second breathing cycle that resonates with the circuit of heart rate and blood pressure. This breathing pattern is known as Resonant Breathing.

There are various modes of deep and slow breathing, among which Resonant Breathing is the one that has been widely studied.

Studies indicate that resonant breathing can significantly reduce negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and anger and improve creativity and athletic performance[^1][^2]. Patients with chronic pain, asthma, and pre-hypertension can mitigate their symptoms by practicing resonant breathing [^3][^4][^5].

Guided Breathing mode in the Flowtime App will guide you to practice resonant breathing through sounds, images, and vibrations.

As you breathe steadily and regularly in resonance, the heart rate change will then show a steady, highly ordered state called **Coherence Time**. It's a state of enhanced cognition and energetic calm. If your breath is not stable, it is not easy to achieve Coherence Time, but you can improve that through regular breathing exercises.
