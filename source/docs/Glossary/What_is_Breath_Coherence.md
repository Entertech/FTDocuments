## What is Breath Coherence

Breathing patterns affect the pattern of heart rate variability [^1]. When you are doing slow and regular deep breathing, like inhalation for 5 seconds and exhalation for 5 seconds, marked by a highly ordered, smooth pattern of heart rate variability, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems can be synchronized with each other. We name this state **Breath Coherence / Coherence Time.**


At this time, the two branches of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, are coordinating with each other, and you are achieving a state of cognitive enhancement and energetic calm. This state is associated with increased concentration, fast reaction, memory, and emotional stability [^2][^3]
