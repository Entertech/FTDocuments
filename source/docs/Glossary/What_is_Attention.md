## What is Attention?

Our brainwave changes according to what we are doing.[^1][^2] When you focus your mind, studies have shown that the high-frequency energy of brain waves increases, and the low-frequency energy decreases.[^3][^4][^5]


Flowtime collects real-time brainwaves through the headband and measures the user's attention level. Based on extensive data analysis, the Attention algorithm calculates attention by analyzing the spectral characteristics of brainwaves. If the value turns higher,  it means your brain is more active.

Many types of meditation need you to be focused on things such as your breath or an object. If you realize you are distracted, you need to come back and focus your mind on it again.

:::note
Brainwave frequency varies from person to person. The algorithm needs to set a baseline for you at the beginning of meditation. Please minimize your face movements like blinking, gritting teeth, or moving eyes within the 30s after you start to meditate to have an accurate baseline.
