## What is Pressure?

There is a significant correlation between pressure and heart rate variability.[^1][^2]


Pressure affects physical health, and continuing exposure to high stress may increase the risk of chronic diseases.[^3]


The Pressure monitoring algorithm evaluates the perceived stress by analyzing factors such as heart rate variability. The high value of Pressure indicates a higher stress level and likewise the low values.


In the case of drinking, getting sick, lacking sleep, etc., the Pressure may be higher than normal. Exercise may affect the measurement of pressure.

:::note
The Pressure calculation needs more bio-data. Therefore, it takes a bit longer to have the result (generally more than 1 minute).
