## What is Flow?

When you become fully absorbed in the present moment, you get into a state of Flow. Flow in meditation can lead to a range of benefits, including reduced stress and anxiety, increased focus and concentration, and improved overall well-being[^1].

During meditation, there is typically a shift in brainwave patterns from the beta waves to alpha waves associated with relaxation and calm focus[^2]. With continued practice, the patterns can shift even further into the theta waves associated with deep relaxation and meditation[^3]. In this state, you are able to maintain focused attention and experience a sense of timelessness and effortless action, similar to the experience of being in flow.

FLOWTIME analyzes brainwaves in real-time to evaluate the depth and state of meditation. The Flow trend shows how long and how deep you reached the state.
