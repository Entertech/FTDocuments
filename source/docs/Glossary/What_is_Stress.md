## What is Stress?

There is a significant correlation between stress and heart rate variability.[^1][^2]


Stress affects physical health, and continuing exposure to high stress may increase the risk of chronic diseases.[^3]


The Stress monitoring algorithm evaluates the perceived stress by analyzing factors such as heart rate variability. The high value of stress indicates a higher stress level and likewise the low values.


In the case of drinking, getting sick, lacking sleep, etc., the Stress may be higher than normal. Exercise may affect the measurement of stress.

:::note
The Stress calculation needs more bio-data. Therefore, it takes a bit longer to have the result (generally more than 1 minute).
