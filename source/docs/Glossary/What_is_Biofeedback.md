## What is Biofeedback?

Biofeedback is a way to help you take control of your body by providing real-time feedback on your physiological state.

As we all know that meditation has many benefits. It can help us both to focus more and to achieve deep relaxation. In your daily practice, we recommend focusing on one goal at a time. By setting a specific, measurable goal that allows for timely feedback, the effects of each practice are more perceptible and optimizable.

You can choose one of the provided metrics as your goal for your practice, and choose a sound you like as a reward for achieving the desired state of duration. For example, when you choose "bell" as the feedback sound with "5s" as the feedback interval, you will hear a "bell" sound when you reach the "Flow"state after 5s, and if you are still in the state of "heart flow" after 5s, you will hear the sound again.

This way, you can train your mind and body to enter and maintain a state of harmony and balance, while enjoying the pleasant sounds. Biofeedback meditation is a powerful tool for enhancing your well-being and performance.
