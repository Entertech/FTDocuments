## What is Heart Rate?

Heart Rate (HR), also known as pulse, is the number of times a person's heartbeats per minute. [^1]


A normal person's resting heart rate is typically 50-90 BPM. [^2]


In some real-life scenarios, the heart rate is calculated over a much shorter period of time in order to obtain real-time heart rate changes. [^3]


:::note
PPG (photoplethysmography) sensors on the Flowtime headband use light-based technology to acquire the heart rate, which is accurate when they have good contact with the skin.
