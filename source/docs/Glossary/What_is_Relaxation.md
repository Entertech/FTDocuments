## What is Relaxation?

When you are calm and relaxed, brain waves have unique characteristics, as studies have shown a link between increased alpha wave energy and relaxation.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

The waves will be captured by Flowtime sensors and the algorithm which is built based on large data analysis will measure how relaxed you are and generate an index to manifest that.

This Relaxation, not the same as the relaxed feeling of your body, reflects the mental relaxation degree. When the value is high, the brain is relaxed but also alert, while when it's low, the brain is nervous or anxious.


By deep breathing and closing eyes, your relaxation level will go up.

:::note
Brainwave frequency varies from person to person. The algorithm needs to set a baseline for you. To have an accurate baseline, please minimize your face movements like blinking, gritting teeth, or moving eyes within the 30s after you start to meditate.
